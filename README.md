Meet potential caregivers - If possible, meet the actual people who would provide care
Trust your instincts - If something feels wrong, investigate further

Red Flags to Never Ignore:

Unlicensed or expired licenses
No liability insurance or bonding
Reluctance to provide references
High-pressure sales tactics
Frequent caregiver turnover

Getting the Most Value
This checklist is most effective when used as part of a comprehensive evaluation process. Don't rely solely on interviews - verify information, check references, and consider starting with short-term arrangements to test the provider's capabilities before making long-term commitments.
Remember: The goal isn't to find the perfect provider (they don't exist), but to find the right provider for your family's specific needs, budget, and circumstances.
